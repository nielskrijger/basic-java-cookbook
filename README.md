Basic-java-cookbook
===================

This Chef cookbook installs java.

The basic-java-cookbook has very limited configurability and likely you'll want to use
the official java cookbook for your deployments instead.

Personally I find the community cookbooks too complicated; this cookbook is tailored to my personal
needs.
