Basic-java-cookbook
===================

This repository installs a specified java version on the VM.

The basic-java-cookbook does not offer any functionality whatsoever and likely you'll want to use
the official java cookbook for your deployments instead.

Personally I found those way too complicated for my taste; this cookbook contains just a couple of
lines of code to achieve what I need.
